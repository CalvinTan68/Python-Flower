# Python-Flower
I don't even know why does this trend exists, but it's fun to do some coding

This is a flower with black background and red colored flower. Clone this project by 
```git
  git clone https://github.com/CalvinTan68/Python-Flower.git
```

#### BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED ON YOUR DEVICE
